Subject to change

The assets folder contains 3 subfolders for blocks, entities, and items
Each separate block, entity, and item should have their own .json file

These json files contain all the data these assets should be created with
including the textures they use, their names and ids, and any other special
info they need such as structures to contain inventories or manage health.

Blocks: cubes to be rendered into the world scene or stored in inventories
Entities: monsters, animals, player, items on ground etc.
Items: 2d objects to be stored in player inventory

Blocks can be stored in inventories or in the world where they are stored in chunks

Block json files are to have certain properties:
id: The ID of the block to be referenced in game, should be same as filename (might remove this one if it proves to be useless)
data: Extra data a block needs such as an inventory for a chest, a script to cook items in a furnace, the direction stairs are facing etc.
displayName: The text to be displayed on mouseover in the inventory
miningLevel: The minimum tool strength to recieve drops
hardness: The time it takes to break this block with a tool of the minimum level to mine it in seconds i.e: stone with hardness 1 takes 1 second to break with wooden pickaxe
tool: the correct tool to mine this block with
drops: the items that are to be dropped upon mining this block
